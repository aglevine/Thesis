%%%% Your abstract, used for the UMI abstract and in your front matter
\setabstract{%
%This thesis describes a standard model cross section measurement of $\Wbb$ 
%as well as a search for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric 
%extension of the standard model (MSSM) decaying to tau pairs.

%The measurement of $\Wbb$ was performed
%using proton-proton
%collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7~\mathrm{TeV}$ in a data sample collected
%with the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to
%an integrated luminosity of  $5.0~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}.$
%The $\mathrm{W+b\bar{b}}$
%events are selected in the $\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mu\nu$ decay mode by requiring a
%muon with transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}>25~\mathrm{GeV}$ and pseudorapidity
%$|\eta|<2.1$, and exactly two b-tagged jets with $p_{\mathrm{T}}>25~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $|%\eta|<2.4$.
%The measured $\mathrm{W+b\bar{b}}$ production cross section in the fiducial region, %calculated at the level of final-state particles, is
%$0.53\pm 0.05~(\textrm{stat.}) \pm 0.09~(\textrm{syst.}) \pm 0.06~(\textrm{th.}) \pm %0.01~(\textrm{lum.}) ~\textrm{pb}$,
%in agreement with the standard model prediction. This measurement is a sensitive
%test of heavy quark production calculated with perturbative QCD. It also 
%serves as an important
%benchmark in new physics searches which include a 
%single isolated lepton and one or more b jets in the final state,
%as $\Wbb$ becomes an irreducible background.

%The search for neutral Higgs bosons in their decay to tau pairs is performed 
%using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC
%in 2011 and 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. 
%The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 24.6~fb$^{-1}$, 
%with 4.9~fb$^{-1}$ at 7 TeV and 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ at 8 TeV. To enhance 
%the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search
% includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association 
% with a b-quark jet. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass 
% spectrum. 
 %Exclusion limits in the MSSM parameter space of $M_A$ 
 %and tan$\beta$ in the $m_h^{\rm max}$ scenario are presented.
