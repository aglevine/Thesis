Chapter 2:
**********
2.1 
Meant to say that sea quarks dominated valence quarks. Rewrote sentences about gluon/sea quark/valence quark contributions in the collisions
Rewrote paragraph about pileup.
"detailed simulations" -> "detailed simulations of this process"

2.2
Removed "Mention Prior results" from title
fixed figure reference
"ultimatly" -> "ultimately"
added "detect and reconstruct muons with high efficiency"
"show" -> "shown"
"G_F is a fundamental constant of the Standard Model"


2.3
"mu" -> Î¼ 
"This will force" -> "This forces"

Chapter 5: 
**********

5.1
changed "are due to neutral particles" to "assumed to be due to neutral particles"
added more info about b-jets in 5.4, explained how their secondary vertices are distinguished from nuclear interaction secondary vertices.
added "type"
added and cited more professional figure

5.2
added "found in the ECAL"
detector -> tracker
referred to section 5.1 for standard iterative tracking procedure
changed "detector" to "tracker"
added "in the tracker"
removed incomplete sentence "Tracks linked to cluster if..." The sentence was part of a draft that wasn't removed
"ECAL" -> ECAL energy
removed "then"

5.3
"KF" -> "Kalman Filter", added section reference
global muons defined
Should have said "tracker muon" not "standalone muon". Moved statement about muon resolution to the next paragraph and rephrased.

5.4
added chapter and section.
reworded to avoid CMS jargon (L2L3), added information about residual corrections

5.5
energy -> momentum
