Chapter 6

Note: I made the unlabeled introduction text its own section (6.1: Analysis Overview). So your comments in 6.1 now apply to section 6.2, etc. 

6.1
missing energy -> missing transverse energy
6.2
Added lots of details to fake rate discussion
6.3
added citation for Pythia8
added citation for Tauola
added citation for Pythia6
added citation for embedded sample
added citation for Madgraph
independant -> independent 
referenced mc software section
added reference for CT10 PDF

6.4
Added 13 TeV tables after presel and after selection
**percentage of VBF events

6.6
evaluated b -> evaluated by
catories -> categories
**find reference for cuet2 and z2**
fixed broken reference for jet energy scale, reference includes next few sentences
***add more information about jet energy scale uncertainty
Added reference for tau energy scale
***show fake rate systematic
show -> shown
added higgs to tau tau, z to tau tau refs as examples of analysis that performed useful studies in 2012.
Referenced previous discussion about theoretical uncertaintie in LFV at 8 TeV


Chapter 7

Added introduction (section 7.1)
7.2.1 
referenced rapidity separation from LFV section
7.2.2
"with" makes more grammatical sense here than "have"
cited amc@nlo
cited powheg
cited mcfm
PYTHIA in proper formatting
7.2.3
added isolation information about muons in QCD regions
added iterative QCD scale factors, before and after computation
did -> does

7.3
Added that the analysis focuses on associated jets, in addition to the W boson
fixed greater than sign
*** Add plot of puMVA, add table (cut flow from b tag  -> puMVA -> both)

7.4
*** Add ttbar plots
*** Add W boson plots (like Kira has)

7.5
removed comment about infallibility
an -> a
Then -> The second step is to
accout -> account

7.6
Explained jet energy uncertainty in more detail and added a reference to the applicable table
Added reference for lumi
7.6.1 
varying these scales -> halving or doubling these scales
in Monte Carlo -> in the Monte Carlo
***fixed equation number (check)
***update systematics after talk

7.7
measured -> measured for
***conclusion of madgraph underestimation
break down -> breakdown
*** get rid of tiny and rotate tables
