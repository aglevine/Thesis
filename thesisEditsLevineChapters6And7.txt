Chapter 6

Note: I made the unlabeled introduction text its own section (6.1: Analysis Overview). So your comments in 6.1 now apply to section 6.2, etc. 

6.1
missing energy -> missing transverse energy
6.2
Added lots of details to fake rate discussion
6.3
added citation for Pythia8
added citation for Tauola
added citation for Pythia6
added citation for embedded sample
added citation for Madgraph
independant -> independent 
referenced mc software section
added reference for CT10 PDF

6.4
Added 13 TeV tables after presel and after selection
Added percentage of VBF events. Will make a table with more time.

6.6
evaluated b -> evaluated by
catories -> categories
added references for cuet2 and z2
fixed broken reference for jet energy scale, reference includes next few sentences
added more information about jet energy scale uncertainty, probably need to add some more plots.
Added reference for tau energy scale
showed fake rate systematic
show -> shown
added higgs to tau tau, z to tau tau refs as examples of analysis that performed useful studies in 2012.
Referenced previous discussion about theoretical uncertaintie in LFV at 8 TeV

6.7
Added lumi uncertainty reference
defined postfit
Added citation for asymptotic approximation
Added more information about the p-value (I also had already mentioned 5sigma in the next sentence, not sure if you saw it)

6.8
Fixed broken reference to figure
V(H->mutau) to B(H->mutau)
referred to prior yukawa couplings discussion
removed the last sentence on Table 6.9's caption

Chapter 7

Added introduction (section 7.1)
7.2.1 
referenced rapidity separation from LFV section
7.2.2
"with" makes more grammatical sense here than "have"
cited amc@nlo
cited powheg
cited mcfm
PYTHIA in proper formatting
7.2.3
added isolation information about muons in QCD regions
added iterative QCD scale factors, before and after computation
did -> does

7.3
Added that the analysis focuses on associated jets, in addition to the W boson
fixed greater than sign
Added plot of puMVA, added table

7.4
*** Need to Add ttbar plots
*** Need to Add W boson plots (like Kira has)

7.5
removed comment about infallibility
an -> a
Then -> The second step is to
accout -> account

7.6
Explained jet energy uncertainty in more detail and added a reference to the applicable table
Added reference for lumi
7.6.1 
varying these scales -> halving or doubling these scales
in Monte Carlo -> in the Monte Carlo
fixed equation number
Added information about 8 variations of renormalization/factorization scales

7.7
measured -> measured for
***need to add conclusion of madgraph underestimation
break down -> breakdown
*** need to add get rid of tiny and rotate tables
