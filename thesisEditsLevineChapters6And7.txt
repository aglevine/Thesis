Chapter 6

Note: I made the unlabeled introduction text its own section (6.1: Analysis Overview). So your comments in 6.1 now apply to section 6.2, etc. 

6.1
missing energy -> missing transverse energy

6.2
added citation for Pythia8
added citation for Tauola
added citation for Pythia6
added citation for embedded sample
added citation for Madgraph
independant -> independent 
Added lots of details to fake rate discussion

Chapter 7

Added introduction (section 7.1)
7.2.1 
referenced rapidity separation from LFV section
7.2.2
"with" makes more grammatical sense here than "have"
cited amc@nlo
cited powheg
cited mcfm
PYTHIA in proper formatting
7.2.3
added isolation information about muons in QCD regions
added iterative QCD scale factors, before and after computation
did -> does

7.3
Added that the analysis focuses on associated jets, in addition to the W boson
fixed greater than sign
*** Add plot of puMVA, add table (cut flow from b tag  -> puMVA -> both)

7.4
*** Add ttbar plots
*** Add W boson plots (like Kira has)

7.5
removed comment about infallibility
an -> a
Then -> The second step is to
accout -> account

7.6
Explained jet energy uncertainty in more detail and added a reference to the applicable table
Added reference for lumi
7.6.1 
varying these scales -> halving or doubling these scales
in Monte Carlo -> in the Monte Carlo
***fixed equation number (check)
***update systematics after talk

7.7
measured -> measured for
***conclusion of madgraph underestimation
break down -> breakdown
*** get rid of tiny and rotate tables
