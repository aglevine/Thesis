3.1
Added that high current in superconducting magnets is necessary for high magnetic field.
Oops.. that made no sense. Magnetic field is obviously constant to keep particles in their circular path. Changed "magnetic field is controlled by" to "beam is accelerated by"
Removed stray phrase "The emittance"
"is lower in 2015" -> "was lower in 2015"
added 2016 LHC performance
"collisions" -> "proton proton collisions"

3.2.1
"hermetic" -> "mostly hermetic"

3.2.2
Added information about pixel resolution and referenced displaced vertices.
charge -> charged

3.2.3
"hermetic" -> "mostly hermetic"
"distance" -> "mean distance"
"the particle" -> "electron"
"shower" -> "electron shower"
added that ECAL crystals are temperature dependent as well
"dependant" -> "dependent"
added that preshower is located in front of the ecal

3.2.4
added better definition for interaction length
removed extra sig fig from length of HCAL
added HO paragraph

3.2.5
"systems" -> "system"
combeind the first two sentences
"magnetic" -> "magnet"
added more information about potential hadronic punchthrough
Added high voltage electrodes
"anode" -> "The anode"
fixed mentions of cathode instead of electrode
"flow" -> "flow away"
Added width of csc strips
CSCs were added for 3/4 tracking for all endcap region
"strips" -> "pads"

3.2.6
"events that are generated" -> "proton proton collisions"
"contains" -> "contain"
added HCAL mapping information
"Sums" -> "Sums from ECAL and HCAL"
"rougher" -> "coarser"
removed random sentence fragment
mentioned oRSC
